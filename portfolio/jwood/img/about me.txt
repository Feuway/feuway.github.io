There is actually not much to say about me. My name is Jason and I'm a photographer based in Bavaria/Germany. My passion is to photograph the beauty of landscapes worldwide. I love to travel and I also love to shoot close to my hometown. Bavaria is a wonderful place in the south of Germany and we have everything a landscape photographer could dream of. Mountains, waterfalls, rivers, forests and canyons are in my backyard. Everytime I come back from travelling to various foreign countries I again realize how much beauty I have around me.
